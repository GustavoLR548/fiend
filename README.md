# Fiend (2001)

Fiend was originally released in 2001 by GripDesign. Most notably, the game was programmed by Thomas Grip, who would eventually become the Creative Director and co-founder of Frictional Games—the studio renowned for the *Penumbra* series, *Amnesia* series, and *SOMA*.

The purpose of this project is to preserve the game for future generations, ensuring people can play it on modern hardware and witness the origins of such an influential company.

## Current State: Fully Playable

As of now, the game is fully playable on Linux and Windows. MacOS support may arrive in the future, but since I do not own any Apple devices, this may take some time (unless a contributor decides to assist with the process).

- **Fiend** - Works on Windows and Linux
- **Mapeditor** - Works on Windows and Linux

## How to build the project

If you are interested in building this project on your machine, go to [BUILD.md](https://github.com/GustavoLR548/fiend/tree/master/docs) and follow the instructions. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/GustavoLR548/fiend/issues).

## Reporting bugs

If you encounter any bugs or errors during gameplay, please open an issue in this repository. The game uses a logging system and generates a file inside the `logs` folder detailing game events. Please attach these logs to your report when creating an issue.

## Future plans

While the project is technically complete, there are options for moving forward. However, I believe that implementing drastic changes (such as new features) should be reserved for a separate "Definitive Edition" project, while this repository remains the "Classic" preservation edition (with only minor features that were implemented to aid in the restoration process).

Potential features for a future edition:

- [ ] Add localization
- [ ] Add more resolution options
- [ ] Add controller support
- [ ] Add separate sliders for music and SFX volume
- [ ] Port the game from using Allegro 4.4.3.1 to Allegro 5
